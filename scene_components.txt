Adding a scene to the game will load all of the GameComponents that the scene
contains into the main game component vector.

Switching scenes will remove all of the GameComponents that are associated with
the current scene and will add all of the components associated with the
new scene.

Of course there will be additional initialization logic. However, once the
scenes have been determined, a state machine similar to the character state
machine can dictate which scene will come next. This will simplify the
scene class, just as the character class has been simplified.
